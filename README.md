# Utterly Nord Light Compatible Theme for GTK

GTK theme based on the appearance of Utterly Nord Light using the Nord Polar color scheme.

I made this to use Evolution under KDE Plasma. Not fully tested with Gnome environment and full set of GTK apps. 
Just to make Evolution and possible future GTK apps compatible with my KDE Plasma look&feel.

Used https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-10 as base.
